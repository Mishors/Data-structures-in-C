# Data Structures in C

This project includes implementation of basic data structures written in C language. 

## Data Structures in this project

Singly linked list is implemented and support the basic operations done on the list and also Hash-table is implemented using arrays and the linked list (implemented in the project) to resolve collision of hashed keys.

## Singly Linked List

### Supported Opearations
```
* get_element - Allocate memory for new node then initializes its value with the input "value"and set its next node to NULL
```
```
* get_tail - Get the tail of the list i.e: last element
```
```
* add_front - Add element to be before the head of the list (i.e: to be the new head)
```
```
* add_back - Add element to be after the tail of the list (i.e: to be the new tail)
```
```
* remove_head - Remove head node and the next to head becomes the new head
```
```
* remove_tail - Remove the tail of the list
```
```
* remove_element - Removes the first occurrence of the input value from the list. Hint: If the removed node is the head the next to head becomes the new head (Implemented for integer Linked Lists ONLY)
```

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
